    "It was SA-launch and final project was to create a whatever service using AWS service. I was in charge of backend, and another guy used Slack bot created a frontend which can taking in an photo of a food ingredient tabel and later gives a warning if certain allergetic ingredients are found in the list. I was quite amazed by how easy it was to setup the whole UI pipeline using Slack bot, and the infrastructure of the backend, which is API Gateway plus Lambda function, was reused again and again in my later prototypes. \n",
