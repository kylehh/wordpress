    "\"How to create Slack bot which interact with AWS Lambda\"  \n",
    "This is the prompt I entered for GPT4, and there are the answers from it\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Slack App and Bot:\n",
    "- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and sign in to your Slack account.\n",
    "- Click \"Create New App\", provide a name and select a workspace for development, then click \"Create App\".\n",
    "- In the \"Add features and functionality\" section, click on \"Bots\" and then \"Add a bot\".\n",
    "- Give your bot a display name and default username, then click \"Add Bot\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set up API permissions:\n",
    "- In the Slack App settings, go to the \"OAuth & Permissions\" tab.\n",
    "- Scroll down to \"Scopes\" and add required bot token scopes (e.g., \"app_mentions:read\", \"chat:write\", \"commands\" and any other relevant scopes).\n",
    "- Click \"Install App\" at the top of the page and then \"Install App to Workspace\".\n",
    "- Authorize the app in your workspace and take note of the \"Bot User OAuth Token\" displayed, as you'll need it later.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an AWS Lambda function:\n",
    "- Sign in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to the Lambda service.\n",
    "- Click \"Create function\" and choose \"Author from scratch\".\n",
    "- Provide a function name and select a runtime (e.g., Python 3.8).\n",
    "- In the \"Function code\" section, upload your code as a .zip file or provide a repository link if using the \"Code entry type\" as \"Upload a file from Amazon S3\" or \"Use a repository from GitHub or CodeCommit\".\n",
    "- Set up the execution role for your Lambda function.\n",
    "- Click \"Create function\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create an API Gateway:\n",
    "- In the AWS Management Console, go to the API Gateway service.\n",
    "- Click \"Create API\" and choose \"REST API\".\n",
    "- Select \"New API\" and provide a name and description.\n",
    "- Create a new resource and method (e.g., POST) and set the integration type to \"Lambda Function\".\n",
    "- Select the Lambda function you created earlier and save the changes.\n",
    "- Deploy the API by selecting \"Actions\" > \"Deploy API\" and choose a deployment stage (e.g., \"prod\").\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Update your Slack App with the API Gateway URL:\n",
    "- Copy the \"Invoke URL\" from your API Gateway's \"Stages\" section.\n",
    "- Go back to your Slack App's settings and navigate to the \"Event Subscriptions\" tab.\n",
    "- Toggle \"Enable Events\" on and paste the API Gateway URL into the \"Request URL\" field.\n",
    "- Add relevant event subscriptions (e.g., \"app_mention\") and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Develop your Lambda function:\n",
    "- Write the code for your Lambda function to handle incoming Slack events, process them, and send responses back to Slack.\n",
    "- Use the \"Bot User OAuth Token\" from step 2 to authenticate requests to the Slack API.\n",
    "- You can use libraries like slack-sdk (Python) or @slack/bolt (Node.js) to interact with the Slack API.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Test your Slack bot:\n",
    "- Invite the bot to a channel in your Slack workspace and interact with it to test its functionality."
