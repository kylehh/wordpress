# Gamma Function

The overall landscape of the Beta and Gamma world is that we have two versions of both: on one hand, we have the Beta function and the Beta distribution, which is then mirrored by the Gamma function and the Gamma distribution. While we could theoretically start with any one of the four, weâ€™ll start with the Gamma function.

## Definition

The Gamma function is written as 
$$
\Gamma(x) = \int_0^\infty t^{x - 1} e^{- x} \, dx
$$
