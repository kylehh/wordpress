I started writing blogs since BBS time, but unfortunately most early time writings are lost  
  
Then I blogged on MSN spaces, which was closed down later and all blogs were transferred to wordpress.com (You can still find my blogs there~)    

I blogged on WeChat these days, mostly posting pictures, and recording my random thoughts

Actually I didn't know what's the purpose of having another blog-ish thing, till one day I found that it can be used to record my learnings.

I read Lilian's blog about Stable Diffusion, watched Hungyi Lee's lectures on youtube about various topics of ML

But I easily lost track of what I learnt after some time, so I decided to record them down, which is easy for me to review and learn better
